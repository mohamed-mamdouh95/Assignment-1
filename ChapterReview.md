1) A class is a construct which defines data and behaviour for objects.

2)abstruction means separating interface from implementation and this happens by classes as we separate implementation into class "functions" 
and using this funtion into our source code by just calling functions.
- encapsulation means disallowing access to or knowledge of internal structure of an implmentation and this happens by usning private and public keywords.   
-data hidding is achieved by using pointers and struct.

3)class defines behavior and properties of objects.

4)class function members describe what the object can do but data members describe the object data or details.

6)class constructor is called when creating a new object of a class. 
destructor is called when the object goes out of scope.

8)default constructor is a consturctor with no parameter..it's useful for automatically initializing objects with desired data.

10)this pointer provides acess to object's own address.
